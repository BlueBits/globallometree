                The Allometric equation's database center provides access to the tree allometric equations by ecological zones, countries or continents. They can be used to assess volume, biomass and carbon of trees in various types of forests (native, secondary, bamboo, mangroves, plantations etc.). The data are collected from the scientific literature, reports from logging companies, conference proceedings, and national reports. The data are harmonized to facilitate their use (access to the methodology). The harmonization procedure takes into account the tree components  (stem, root, branch, leaf, etc..), geographical location (ecological zone, country, continent), the statistics information (correlation coefficient , sample size, confidence intervals etc.) and the reference. The data are those originally reported by the authors. Errors can appear in certain equations. We try to detect errors and suggest corrections. The users can find a list of suggested equations in case errors are detected (access to modified database).
